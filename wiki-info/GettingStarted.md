# Getting Started

# The Basics

## Create a Page

For creation of a new page, under the current directory `wiki-info`.  
Create a new Markdown file and title it appropriately.  
Once the page has been created, you will need to add it to the main Markdown file `Sailex Wiki.md`.  
This will be a step-by-step process if you are unsure on how this works.  

# Syntax

The syntax for the wiki will be the same syntax that you can find anywhere Markdown is present. There are be no surprises here.
